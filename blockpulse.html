                <p><strong>This case study outlines the redesign of a blockchain-powered fundraising platform aimed at helping SMEs raise capital and allowing investors to discover and fund high-potential businesses completely digitally.

            <h2>The challenge</h2>
                <p>Despite a strong technological foundation and the growing relevance of blockchain in fundraising, the platform was struggling with:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Low product/brand awareness</strong> among potential SME clients and investors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Low conversion rates</strong> on the marketing website.</li>
                    <li><strong>High user drop-off rates</strong> during onboarding and campaign creation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Usability issues</strong> throughout the core product such as campaign setup and investment flows.</li>
                    <li><strong>Limited active users (MAUs)</strong> despite sign-ups, indicating poor retention.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr>
            <h2>Objectives</h2>
                <h3>Primary goals</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Increase monthly active users (MAUs)</strong> by 40% in 6 months.</li>
                        <li><strong>Improve conversion rate</strong> on the marketing site by 50%.</li>
                        <li><strong>Improve usability and task success rate</strong> on key user flows (onboarding, investment, campaign creation).</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>Secondary goals</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Clarify brand positioning and messaging to attract investors and founders.</li>
                        <li>Reimagine and visual identity to appear more confident and trustworthy.</li>
                        <li>Build trust in blockchain-backed transactions via better UX and communication.</li>
                    </ul>

            <h2>Target users</h2>
                <p>We needed to figure out who this was for in order to test with and design for the right user.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Small and Medium Enterprises (start-up & scale-up) founders:</strong> Seeking non-traditional, fast capital raising methods.</li>

                    <p>Insights from 20 users (10 founders, 10 investors) revealed:</p>

                    <p>The largest portion of users were using the platform on desktop, which remained the priority. However, a non-negligeable part of the userbase used the product on their mobile phones. The PWA was optimised to be responsive and work on any display as a result. </p>

            <h2>Collaboration &amp; Implementation</h2>
                <p><strong>I collaborated closely with engineers</strong> to ensure pixel-perfect, functional results. Together, we built a <strong>strong Design System</strong> (components and patterns) to improve efficiency, scalability, and consistency. </p>
                <p>We wanted to <strong>avoid waterfall-type handoffs</strong>, and while we did have regular UI QA ceremonies, we relied a lot more on day to day ad-hoc conversations and check-ins. This resulted in rich, multi-disciplinary discussions from which lots of ideas and improvements were born.</p>

            <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clear educational UI is essential when introducing blockchain tech to non-tech-savy users.</li>
                    <li>Trust signals (like third-party audits, testimonials, secure wallet integrations) directly influence conversion.</li>
                    <li>Onboarding flows tailored by user role benefited their completion rate immensely.</li>
                </ul>
